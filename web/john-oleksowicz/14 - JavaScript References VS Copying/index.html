    const team = players;

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
	team.push('Jimmy');

    // however what happens when we update that array?
	console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
	const team3 = [].concat(players);
	team2.push('team2specific');
	team3.push('team3specific');
	console.log(team, team2, team3);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Team4';

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
    	name: 'John O',
        age: 200
    };

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
//    const jimmy = person;
//    jimmy.name = 'Jimmy';
//    console.log(person, jimmy)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
	const jimmy = Object.assign({}, person, {name: 'Jimmy'});
	console.log(person, jimmy);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
//    const person3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const john = {
    	name: 'John',
        age: '100',
        nested: {
    		one: 1,
            two: 2
        }
    };

    const john2 = Object.assign({}, john);
	console.log(john, john2);

	// Poor man's deep clone
	const john3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(john));
