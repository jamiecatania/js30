## FAQs

| Question | Answer |
| -------- | ------ |
| Can I come too? | Yup! |
| Where do I get the starter files? | [Right here](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)
| Where should I put my stuff in the repo? | Create a directory inside the `/web` folder with your name and put whatever you want in there.)
| What branching strategy are we using? | I'm okay with everything being committed directly to the `master` branch if you are. Just be sure to only update things in your own directory, unless someone specifically asks you for help in their directory.
| Can I view my stuff online somewhere? | Yes! Check out [http://javascript30code.club/](http://javascript30code.club/). It's password protected -- check the slack channel for username/password.
